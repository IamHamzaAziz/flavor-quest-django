# FlavorQuest - Recipe Sharing Web App

## Overview

This web application allows users to share recipes alongside saving recipes of other users like we save posts on social media platforms. This application involves user authentication and users can share recipes, edit and delete them as well. Each recipe will require an image upload for it as well. In addition to users can apply filters to get specific recipes as well.

## Frontend

For frontend, I used HTML, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) components and [Tailblocks](https://tailblocks.cc/).

## Backend

Django framework is used in order to build the backend for this project.

## Database

I used SQLite database for this project.

## Primary Key

Rather than using conventional ids, I used uuids (uuid4 more specifically) here.
